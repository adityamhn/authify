## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Node.js version 18.17 or later
- Docker for managing databases and services

### Setting Up Your Local Environment

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Authify repository into your local environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adityamhn/authify.git
```

#### 2. Initialize Local Servers (MongoDB and Redis)

We will use Docker to start your local MongoDB and Redis servers. Go to the directory where you have cloned the repo and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### 3. Launch the Backend

Now, launch a new terminal and navigate into the backend directory in the repository: 

```bash
cd ./backend
```

Now once you are in the backend directory, execute the command below to start the backend server:

```bash
# run "npm install" to install all the dependency packages

npm run dev & npm run watch
```

Verify the backend is running by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

#### 4. Start the Frontend

Now, launch a new terminal and navigate into the frontend directory in the repository: 

```bash
cd ./frontend
```

Now once you are in the frontend directory, execute the command below to start the frontend server:

```bash
# run "npm install" to install all the dependency packages

npm run dev
```

Confirm the frontend is operational by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
